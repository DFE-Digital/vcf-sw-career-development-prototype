  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why the Supervision Standard matters</h2>
<p class="govuk-body-m">The standard identifies regular, critically reflective supervision as a baseline for the effective delivery of social work and social care practice. This aligns with the view of various influential reports12 published over the last few decades that consider reflective supervision as ’the cornerstone of good practice‘13. This section of the resource sets out why the frequency and quality of social work supervision is important and why it contributes to an organisation’s overall effectiveness.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">The role of reflective supervision is to ensure that the primary task of the organisation is achieved through the direct practice of its practitioners. Supervision should be designed to enable the very best work with people who access services, promoting the use of skilful, evidence-informed practice. It should facilitate risk assessment and careful analysis, promoting effective decision-making and planning to ensure positive outcomes.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Given that social work and social care practice are emotionally demanding, supervision should also ensure that the wellbeing of workers is prioritised (see ES Wellbeing for further information). It serves as a source of support, improving role clarity and enhancing job satisfaction.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Some useful evidence-informed insights for you as employers and leaders can be found in an international review of the effectiveness of supervision in child and family social work and adult social care (Carpenter et al.,2013) and a more recent rapid review of the research on reflective supervision (Ravalier et al., 2023). Both reviews acknowledge that, while no firm conclusions can be reached regarding ’what works‘, there is emerging evidence for the importance of supervision for improved outcomes at both organisational and individual levels. These sources underscore the significance of supervision being frequent, high-quality, and reflective to benefit the professional practice, retention and wellbeing of workers.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Additionally, some evidence suggests that good-quality supervision might enhance the quality of direct practice and potentially lead to improved outcomes for service users.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Meeting this standard has the potential for benefits across the organisation, enabling employers to fulfil their primary task of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and families and supporting individuals who are older or living with disability, physical or mental illness to live independently, stay well, and safe. Adhering to this standard can also contribute to meeting additional standards, such as the Strong and Clear Social Work Framework (ES1) and Wellbeing (ES4).</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Below is a summary of evidence to date as to why reflective supervision is important for you as an employer. Much of the research relates to social work but, evidence from associated professions is included.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">PLACEHOLDER Photo/visual to break up page</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How effective Supervision benefits employers and organisations</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Improved critical thinking and job performance</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Good quality supervision is linked to social workers’ positive perceptions of their own critical thinking skills which, in turn, can lead to improved job performance. There is evidence suggesting that workers believe reflective supervision can positively impact their direct practice18. Organisations with a reflective learning culture, fostered by reflective supervision, enable practitioners to discuss errors more openly. In such environments, errors are responded to with curiosity and a focus on learning rather than blame and shame19. This creates a culture where mistakes are opportunities for growth.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Improved job satisfaction</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Working environments with regular, structured supervision, provided by an expert, and actively involving the supervisee, are associated with higher levels of job satisfaction20. Supervision that is focused on new skill acquisition further enhances job satisfaction. The quality of the relationship between the supervisor and supervisee is crucial for effective supervision and linked to higher job satisfaction and better direct practice21. Job satisfaction is likely to benefit practitioners' overall wellbeing and their ability to manage their workload effectively. This, in turn, has positive implications for retention, as satisfied and well-supported practitioners are more likely to remain in their roles.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Improved resilience, wellbeing and retention, and reduced stress and burnout.</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Perceptions of good-quality supervision and positive relationships with supervisors are identified as key factors in retaining practitioners in their roles. Reflective supervision is also associated with effective management of the emotional demands of social work, leading to lower risk of stress and burnout23 and improved emotional wellbeing24. Reflective supervision can also contribute to the development of emotional resilience and a commitment to stay in an organisation.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Given the current retention challenges in social work, an increased emphasis on the quality and frequency of supervision is seen as a potential strategy to mitigate attrition25. The importance of effective relationship-based supervision is particularly significant when supporting Black and global majority social workers. A recent survey26 of social workers from ethnic minorities reported their experiences of increased scrutiny and negative assumptions about their skills based on their ethnicity, despite the higher workloads they are assigned.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Additionally, one in ten survey participants said they had considered leaving the profession due to racism. This calls for all social work supervision to be supported by an anti-racist strategy and resources in Part 2 will focus on the tools to support this.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Improved perceptions that the organisation cares for the wellbeing of the workforce. Social workers who receive good-quality reflective supervision are more likely to perceive their organisation and employers as caring for their wellbeing and personal development, as well as appreciating the personal contribution they make27. Feeling appreciated and cared for at work fosters a sense of belonging, self-worth and security. Supervision believed by social workers to be effective is associated with perceptions of their organisational culture as promoting evidenced-based practice and a sense of individual self-efficacy. These positive characteristics have the potential to contribute to staff retention, enhance the perception that the organisation is a positive place to work, and serve as a tool for recruitment.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Contributes to practitioners’ feelings of safety</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Social work organisations have a moral imperative to manage the wellbeing of their employees effectively due to the emotionally demanding nature of social work and social care. There is a sound business case for doing so, as effective management of wellbeing is linked to increased retention and improved performance among employees.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Employers have a legal duty of care to their employees under the Health and Safety at Work Act29. This duty extends to protecting both physical and mental health. Employers are required to support the mental health of their employees and remove or reduce stress ’as far as is reasonably practicable‘.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Effective, frequent and reflective supervision plays a crucial role in accomplishing these objectives. It ensures that social workers feel safe and secure and ‘emotionally held’30. This, in turn, reduces the risk of psychological distress and burnout, mitigating the negative impact of unresolved emotions and distress on professional practice31.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">PLACEHOLDER Reflection box containing a question for the reader to think about related to Supervision and organisations</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-mL">How effective and timely Supervision benefits direct practice</h2>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Improvements in direct practice skill.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Social work supervision that is systemically informed is associated with improved relationship-building skills and the use of ’good authority‘ skills. When supervision is focused on shaping direct practice, it is positively associated with desired outcomes for children and families, such as goal attainment32 and ratings of quality of family life33. There is also evidence for links between supervision and improved relationships with families34as well as enhanced family functioning.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Promotes service user empowerment and participation.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">There is some evidence that supervision can play a role in promoting participation of people accessing services 36. Effective supervision is associated with an increase in positive feedback and a reduction in complaints, as well as enhancing a sense of empowerment among service users37.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Analysis and planning.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Where practitioners receive quality supervision, there is evidence suggesting that their ability to plan purposeful, focused interventions with families is enhanced38. High-quality supervision is also associated with improved critical analysis by practitioners that, in turn, can lead to better planning for appropriate interventions39.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">It is recognised that there is a challenge in defining what constitutes ’good‘ supervision in terms of both quality and frequency. This lack of specificity can impede efforts to clearly outline and measure the effectiveness of supervisory practices beyond the baseline required by the standard. Despite the challenges, promising practices are emerging in the field.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">These practices, , provide valuable insights and examples that can inform action plans for employers looking to improve supervisory practices within their organisations. The identification of barriers, including the collective defence mechanisms of organisations against the anxiety generated by their primary task, highlights the broader organisational dynamics at play.</p>
<p class="govuk-body-m">Organisations may face challenges in effectively managing the emotional demands of their primary task of safeguarding and promoting the well-being of individuals and families and supporting people who are older, or living with disability, physical or mental illness to live independently, stay well and safe.</p>
