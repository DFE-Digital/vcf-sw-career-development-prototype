  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does ‘good’ look like?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body-m">You are responsible for ensuring that your organisation provides regular opportunities for high-quality reflective supervision. However, it is widely acknowledged that there is still much to be learned about what makes reflective supervision ’high-quality‘, how it can be improved and its impact on key outcomes for staff wellbeing and outcomes for people using services. Research in Practice42 identify six evidence-informed principles of reflective supervision for child and family social work that are likely to be helpful to.</p>
<ul class="govuk-list">
  <li>
    1. Deepen and broaden knowledge and critical analysis skills
  </li>
  <li>
    2. Enable confident, competent, creative, and independent decision-making
  </li>
  <li>
    3. Build clear plans for positive change for children and families
  </li>
  <li>
    4. Develop a supportive relationship that helps staff feel valued, supported, and motivated
    </li>
    <li>
      5. Support the development of workers’ emotional resilience and self-awareness 
    </li>
      <li>
        6. Promote the development of a learning culture within the organisation
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">A review of the literature identifies some emerging areas of best practice that offer you, as an employer, strategic tools to meet this standard.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">To improve the quality of supervision, consider implementing the following strategies:</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Define quality.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">To assess quality, you must have a good understanding of what constitutes good reflective supervision. The importance of a balanced approach is identified, incorporating the four functions of support, management, mediation and development. Supervision plays a critical role in upholding and reinforcing professional standards within the field of social work. It also establishes a framework for accountability, ensuring that practitioners are responsible for their actions and decisions. Supervision aims to create an environment where practitioners can thrive and deliver their best possible work. Carpenter’s et al.’s (2013) international review, identifies the following elements of effective supervision:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
    social and emotional support
      </li>
      <li>
    task assistance (or help and support to do the job)
      </li>
      <li>
    an experienced supervisor
      </li>
      <li>
    reflective space
      </li>
      <li>
    a positive relationship between supervisor and supervisee
          </li>
        </ul>
    
    
    <p class="govuk-body-m">The positive supervisory alliance, characterised by a constructive and supportive relationship between the supervisor and the supervisee, is a critical component of effective supervision. A positive supervisory alliance fosters a sense of trust, open communication, and mutual respect, and is also associated with more positive working relationships with people using services.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">A key challenge for supervisors is establishing the effectiveness of supervision. The health check assesses each standard via the self-reported perceptions of social workers, but this

      has potential pitfalls. Therefore, self-reported satisfaction with the effectiveness of supervision should be combined with observations and a strong, evidence-informed vision for the nature and purpose of social work supervision in your organisation. Several of the tools and resources offered in Part 2 will help you achieve this.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Use co-production to establish clear expectations and develop a structured framework.

      The standard requires you to have a supervisory policy in place within your organisation which articulates the expectations for supervisory practice. This might also include materials such as a contract template for supervision, as well as means for recording procedures, frequency, model of delivery, and potential models for supervisory sessions. Like any policy, its effectiveness will rely on practical implementation and continual evolution over time. If not translated into practice and allowed to develop, it runs the risk of being disregarded or executed in a task-oriented and bureaucratic manner. To ensure engagement, it is crucial that practitioners contribute to the creation and assessment of the supervisory policy, preventing it from becoming a mundane document relegated to a ’virtual shelf’.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">A key principle, or golden thread, running through these resources underscores the significance of co-production in securing practitioner ’buy in‘ and cultivating commitment. Co-production entails tapping into the knowledge, skills, abilities, and experiences of individuals at all organisational levels. While co-production may demand more time compared to tasking someone to write a policy independently, the process yields substantial benefits. When individuals can actively contribute ideas and engage in genuine collaboration regarding what makes supervision effective, they are more likely to adhere to the policy. In this way, supervision will be transformed from a set of imposed ’rules‘ from the top into a valuable tool seen as worthwhile. The second part of this resource provides tools to assist you and your managers in creating or reviewing your supervisory policy through co-production techniques.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Develop a learning culture.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">The organisational culture within which supervision operates must be one that nurtures reflection and learning, fostering curiosity and reflexivity. Although leaders may believe they provide opportunities for reflection, supervisory discussions are often driven by task management and compliance-focused agendas46. However, truly reflective organisations acknowledge the significance of critical thinking, learning, and growth. They create spaces for individuals to unpack the complex emotional demands of social work practice. Part 2 of this resource offers tools to assist you in implementing more learning opportunities in your organisation and will also help you to meet other standards, such as CPD (ES6).</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Provide high quality training and resources.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">To ensure high-quality reflective supervision, it is imperative that line managers receive comprehensive and continuous learning and development opportunities. They should have easy access to relevant tools, resources, and frameworks that can support their supervisory practice.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Different employers may take varied approaches, either prescribing a specific supervision model or offering a range of tools and resources, expecting supervisors to choose the most suitable ones for their tasks. Some employers in local authorities will choose to prescribe the model to be used in supervision, whereas others will point supervisors in the direction of a wide range of tools and resources and expect them to use the most appropriate ones for the tasks.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">While evidence suggests that social workers trained in systemically informed approaches are more effective47, this may be influenced by the more frequent evaluation of these models, and the limited availability of comparative data. Of utmost importance is establishing a clear, shared understanding within the organisation regarding the significance of reflective space in supervision. This ensures that any anxieties related to the primary tasks of social work organisations are addressed at the source, rather than being minimised through an excessively prescribed focus on case management, key performance indicators, and a tick-box process.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Creating space for supervisors to reflect on their own supervisory practices is critical. Part 2 of this resource provides an example of a quality assessment and audit tool, emphasising the importance of ongoing self-assessment and improvement in reflective supervision practices. This tool can help maintain a high standard of supervision and contribute to the continuous development of line managers in their roles.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">PLACEHOLDER Do we want to use an icon or symbol for EEDI (equality, equity, diversity and inclusion) as we’re going to be highlighting this throughout these resources?</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Valuing diversity, promoting equity, and fostering inclusion are fundamental principles of effective social work supervision. Those who provide supervision in social work must undergo training on delivering supervision that is relationship-based, inclusive and supportive of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This training should also encompass insights into supporting practitioners with diverse learning and development needs, including those who are neurodiverse. Cultural competence is paramount for supervisors along with an understanding of the systemic oppression experienced by Black and global majority social workers48. They should be aware of barriers and negative power dynamics that can exist in supervisory relationships and take active steps to ensure that their supervision respects diversity and promotes inclusion. This includes understanding the unique challenges and strengths associated with different cultural backgrounds and creating an environment where all voices are heard and valued.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">A range of resources is available via Research in Practice to support practice supervisors develop effective, relationship-based supervisory practice 49.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Prioritise relationship building and fostering a sense of safety and security for practitioners. The significance of good working relationships in social work and social care cannot be overstated. They serve as the foundation for a positive and healthy working culture50.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Positive relationships between a supervisor and supervisee are key to the effectiveness of supervision51. When there is trust, openness, and a sense of psychological safety, reflective conversations can thrive. The organisational culture plays a pivotal role in shaping these relationships. An organisational culture that values trust, learning, reflexivity, and provides a secure base and learning environment is conducive to effective supervision.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Psychological safety is a critical component of a healthy and productive organisational culture. It is the shared belief that the organisation provides a safe space where individuals feel empowered to express their thoughts, raise concerns and contribute without the fear of negative consequences52. This concept applies at the individual, team and organisational level, as it provides emotional containment, ensures a culture of high support and high challenge, increases confidence among practitioners and enables them to learn from their mistakes.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">The resource for Wellbeing (ES4) includes tools to help employers promote psychological safety in their organisations.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Ensure that leaders at all levels of the organisation are emotionally literate anti-oppressive and anti-racist. Compassionate, emotionally literate leadership is a key principle for success in social work organisations. Leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the organisational culture. By fostering a psychologically healthy workplace culture, they support the wellbeing and development of practitioners. Emotionally literate, reflective leaders serve as examples for the organisation. Their commitment to values, building trust, and making sound decisions establishes a positive tone for the entire workforce. Leaders act as role models for appropriate behaviour and decision making. This sets the standards for ethical conduct and professional standards within the organisation.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Emotionally literate leaders actively support the growth of practitioners, by creating an environment where they can thrive and develop their skills. Such leaders demonstrate a reflective approach to problem-solving. Social workers who are from the global majority may experience racism from people who are receiving a service, as well as from colleagues and managers53. Emotionally literate anti-oppressive leaders understand the impact of systemic racism and other forms of discrimination and take action. Leaders can model the importance of support at all levels by engaging in their own ’supervision’. This not only exemplifies the need for ongoing support but also contributes to their own wellbeing.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Implementing an open-door policy where social workers can receive responsive supervision when needed is valuable54. It promotes accessibility and ensures that support is readily available. Recognizing that the quality of the relationship is positively associated with its efficacy, leaders can create opportunities for reflective conversations beyond formal supervision. This enhances the depth and effectiveness of professional relationships.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Implement systemic action planning across the standards.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">Effective, reflective supervision will be more likely in an organisation that fully meets the other standards. In organisations with a well-defined social work framework and effective caseload management systems, and where wellbeing and continued professional development is prioritised, reflective supervision is more likely to be effective.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Spotlight on Camden</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body-m">A recent report from Ofsted highlighted the benefits of the reflective supervision model used in the London Borough of Camden. This highlighted the positive impact that structured and well-supported supervision can have on practitioners, their work with children and families, and their own wellbeing. In this case, Camden adapted Proctor’s (1997)57 ’bells that ring‘ model of group supervision, which allocates roles, implements a structured format, and incorporates a reflective process to the child protection context through a robust focus on risk.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body-m">The bells that ring method is designed to distribute power in the supervision process by allocating specific roles to everyone present, such as presenter, consultant and observers. This approach enables everyone’s voices to be heard, fostering mindful listening, curiosity and the exploration of different perspectives to generate new understandings59. The method aligns with systemic-informed ideas, including curiosity, appreciative enquiry and consideration of various aspects of personal and social identity using the social GGRRAAACCEEESSS (gender, geography, race, religion, age, ability, appearance, class, culture, education, ethnicity, employment, sexuality, sexual orientation and spirituality)60.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Spotlight on Hertfordshire</h2>
          <p>Family Safeguarding is a social work practice model that originated in Hertfordshire and has been widely adopted across children’s services55. This model is multidisciplinary and therapeutically informed, aiming to work more holistically with children and families. Key features of the Family Safeguarding model include the co-location of specialist workers from mental health, substance use, and domestic abuse services with child and family social work teams. Group-based case discussions are a central element, facilitating reflective discussions about the needs of families and incorporating multiple perspectives. The model emphasises a whole family focus, recognising that addressing the needs of children often requires supporting parents in different ways. This approach challenges traditional roles and encourages a more holistic understanding of family dynamics.</p>
