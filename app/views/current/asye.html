        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Overview</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">The assessed and supported year in employment (ASYE) programme helps newly qualified social workers develop their skills, knowledge and professional confidence.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">ASYE is open to all newly qualified social workers employed in the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">It's not mandatory for child and family social workers, but a lot of employers require it.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How you're assessed</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">You’ll be assessed by a qualified social worker against the:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/knowledge-and-skills-statements-for-child-and-family-social-work">post-qualifying standards</a> for child and family practitioners</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.basw.co.uk/professional-development/professional-capabilities-framework-pcf/the-pcf/asye">professional capabilities framework</a> for newly qualified social workers</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">Evidence of your professional development will be collected through:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>direct observations</li>
        <li>feedback from children and young people who need care and support</li>
        <li>feedback from other professionals</li>
        <li>assessment of written reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">You’ll also need to complete critical reflection logs after 3, 6 and 12 months. Your employer can also request an optional 9-month review of your progress.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">At the end of the year your assessor will write a final assessment which your employer will use to decide whether you’ve passed or failed.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How you're supported</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">During your ASYE you'll:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>receive regular supervision</li>
          <li>work a reduced caseload</li>
          <li>time for critical reflection</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">Your assessor will supervise you:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>weekly during weeks 1 to 6</li>
        <li>fortnightly from 6 weeks to 6 months</li>
        <li>monthly for the last 6 months</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">You'll have half a day per week of protected development time, and your workload will be 10% less than an experienced social worker’s.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-m">You'll also be able to shadow experienced social workers and go on placements.</p>
